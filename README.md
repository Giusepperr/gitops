I'll be playing around with various tools in order to establish a working platform.

I'll be investigating various tools to achieve the creation of such platform.

The platform will allow any developer to have a fully functional cloud infrastructure using the various tools described here.

The infra will always try to use a k8s cluster for the core deployment infra.

I need to get used to event driven architecture so I will try to have some simple/free kafca/sqs too.
